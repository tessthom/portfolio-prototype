# Tess Thomas - Portfolio

This is a site built to showcase my web development and design skills.

[Live site](https://tessthomas.com)

## Overview

The first iteration of this site was intended to explore and evaluate the design in mobile-only form, test out integrating Open Props with native CSS, and to explore the benefits of developing with Vite.js.

Vite's dev server is awesome. I think I'll stick to it for the second iteration of this site rather than any kind of rebuild. Time to make things responsive...
